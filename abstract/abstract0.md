#### Biological Foundation

If a group of neurons acts as a concept, we can represent that with lines that connect nodes in a concept map.
But from what I know that's it: there's absolutely no other way to infer anything else about the "structure" of how different neurons (and concepts) are connected
with each other. 
That means the first requirement of this project and the only foundation from where to start is this one:
>1. It has to have, at least, nodes connected with lines


*There are a lot of other background ideas going on with this project but all of them revolve around a central problem.
That means it's better to state it at the beginning in order to have something to base future knowledges on. *
#### Main problematic

What makes me want to rethink mind/concept maps is the fact that it's closely tied to a fixed spatial position.
That means, concepts in a map have a fixed position in a 2d space. 
If we look closely at how concept maps work and if we relate that to how we think, we end up with a lot of fun and interesting questions about the matter. 
* How do mental concepts relate to their representation on a 2d space? 
* What part of the human cognition does a mind map represent?
