#### Biological Foundation

If a group of neurons acts as a concept, we can represent that with lines that connect nodes in a concept map.
But from what I know that's it: there's absolutely no other way to infer anything else about the "structure" of how different neurons (and concepts) are connected
with each other. 
That means the first requirement of this project and the only foundation from where to start is this one:
>1. It has to have, at least, nodes connected with lines
