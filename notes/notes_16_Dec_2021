#### Perspective
I thought the last commit would be enough to make me start actually using the project (i.e. by starting to do some mapping).
I stumbled across the perspective problem far too early:
in the abstract I stated that "perspective" is/will be a problem with this project, but as I started drawing my first 2 concepts I immediately made 2 conclusions:

1. I was right about the paradox of the concept map losing value as we change perspective
2. I didn't want to be right.
3. Space needs to be reinvented

More in detail, I wanted to map many concepts about artificial intelligence. Then I wanted to draw a concept A about "What's my cognition about artificial intelligence"
How exactly should I connect A to? 
There isn't a concept called "AI" because it's made of all the different concepts I previously made. 

Anyways: that's the least of the problems. 
Because, guess what, there actually *is* a paradox.

imagine this situation:
