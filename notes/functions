Functions:

Select:
1. gets coordinates
2. for every concept and node looks if coordinates are between the bounds of those concepts

Edit text:
1. user double clicks a concept
2. a specific keylistener is attached to the jpanel which modifies the Concept's name by text input
3. Exit: when user clicks away, else pressing enter
4. keylistener is deatached from the jframe, main gets back to default state.
5. When drawin all concepts, if a concept's id matches the stored ID of the concept you're editing than it draws a rectangle
   around the text
   
Save:
every second it autosaves -> gets all the concepts and nodes in the map and rewrites them in the same format as they got
loaded.

Add concept:
1. User presses key (C)
2. A new concept is created at cursors position
3. atomatically starts editing this concept

Delete:
1. User presses a key (D)
2. clicked object is destroyed

Scale:
1. no clue how I did that, but it works

Create node:
1. a floating, temporary node is created. If this temporary, "floating" node's coordinates match the coordinates of 2 
   concepts, then this floating node becomes a permanent node. It also changes it's color.

Move:
1. presses space while in DEFAULT mode. Initial cursor position is set
2. keeps updating delta between current cursor position and previous position. Concepts are moved by that vector
3. back to defualt when user presses SPACE again
