# ABANDONED PROJECT
I took a long break from this project because I didn't know how to proceed.
I just stumbled across Zettelkasten, which means there is already some material out there about how to achieve what I want.
Therefore, not having anything close to the knowledge of Zettelkasten's creators, this project is officially abandoned.
In particular, I'm currently using Obsidian software. 

# LifeMap
LifeMap is a project I just started on which I try to provide a way for humans to represent what they think and know in the form of a mind map. 

In the first phase of the project I need to elicit my knowedge about concepts and how they relate to each other.
For example: one of such knowledges would be the apparent paradox for which the connection between concepts changes when we change our perspective on them.
...which, hypotethically, would lead to a situation were a mind map loses all its meaning as we change our perspective. 

This is normally not a problem since we create mind maps exactly to represent some concepts in a determined perspective, but this changes if we want to ambitiously
deleop a mind map that represents our whole life ("life" as intended in an empirical sense). ...In which case, since that hipotetical mind map would represent 
everything we know and every possible way that "everything" is connected inside our mind, it has to be able to represent the dynamism of the human mind.

Some might argue that mind maps can be dynamic: that is, for example, by collapsing specific branches in order to decide on which part of the mind map to focus. 
That might be perhaps dynamic, but it's pretty straightforward to look at "collapsing branches" as a way to modify a static perspective in order to get another
static perspective. I would describe it as taking pictures of what we think in a particular moment but, guess what, that's exactly what I don't want. 

In that example I just gave we would require to spend time and energy in adjusting a mind map to represent what we currently want to think about. 
That might be not a problem, but what worries me is most certainly the fact that with XXXXL mind maps you would need to actually search for what concept you want
to take in consideration. 
"Searching" scales with size while our brain immediately changes perspective, and that seems to bring to an interesting problem I need to think about.
